	<p> Principal Investigator of Computational Neuroanatomy Lab </p>	

<p style="margin-top: 30px;">
I graduated from the Signal Processing department of Tampere University of Technology, Finland, in 2016 and completed my PhD with distinction in medical image processing at the A.I. Virtanen Institute of the University of Eastern Finland in 2021. </br>

I have developed advanced computational tools for segmentation and morphology analysis of large electron and light microscopy datasets, particularly focusing on white matter. Notably, the analyzed datasets are one of the largest electron microscopy volumes of white matter publicly available to date.

Following my PhD, I continued for two years as a postdoctoral fellow with the MRI Biophysics Group at New York University School of Medicine, spearheaded by Profs. Dmitry S. Novikov and Els Fieremans. With Prof. Novikov, we developed a scattering approach that links axonal microgeometry to its diffusion signal, a breakthrough that spans 2-3 orders of magnitude in resolution.</br>

In 2024, I was honored to receive a prestigious four-year grant from the Research Council of Finland to pursue my project on generating Synthetic Brain Tissue that mimics the properties of a biological tissue.
